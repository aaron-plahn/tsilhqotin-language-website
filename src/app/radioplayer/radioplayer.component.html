        We are an Indigenous broadcasting group supporting revitalization and restoration of TsÌ‚ilhqotâ€™in language and culture while building on the need to discuss relevant indigenous issues on a shareable platform to thousands across the country. As the TsÌ‚ilhqotâ€™in Nation won Aboriginal Title in the Supreme Court of Canada- a first in Canadian history- we broadcast important discussions relevant to First Nations, Inuit and Metis across Canada.
